# Data-Analysis-on-MCU-Box-Office-Dataset

# Please Read project_description pdf to know every details of this project

Data Analyst: Mayuresh Koli 
Purpose: 
The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centred on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The MCU is expanding each year, and we know how fans wait for each movie with patience and excitement. Each MCU movie earns millions of dollars at the box office worldwide. Domestic box office will always be higher in most cases, but other than that, which country or region is more profitable for the MCU? I am conducting this data analysis to find out the answer.


Important Notes:
●	Because the MCU began in 2008, it will not include any Marvel films that are not part of the MCU.
●	Marvel TV series and animated series are not included.
●	The dataset will be updated regularly once a new movie is released and their box office is published.
●	Due to no official information about some countries' box office collections, there can be null values. There are many types to deal with and it may depend on your analysis.
●	Another reason for null values is that some movies were never released in some countries, perhaps due to their censor board or may be due to pandemic.
